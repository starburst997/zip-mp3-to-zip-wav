Zip MP3 to Zip WAV

Just a simple tool that takes a Zip File, and replace the MP3 files it encountered to WAV files. Then you can save that zip file.

I needed that because I wanted a precise output of the decoded waveform generated by Flash. So this tool only work inside flash, but I might update it later to other platform as well for testing purpose.

Probably not usefull to anyone but who knows!
